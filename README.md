{JavaScript is a dynamically typed language
Dynamic Typing in JavaScript
1)In a dynamically typed language, variable types are determined at runtime, not at compile time.
2)You don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type is inferred based on the value assigned to it.
3)Variables can hold values of any type, and their types can change during execution

Static Typing (for Comparison)
1)In a statically typed language (e.g., Java, C++, TypeScript), variable types are determined at compile time.
2)You must explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it, and the type cannot change during execution.
